# 📖 Catalog of Things <a name="about-project"></a>

**Catalog of Things** is a comprehensive and user-friendly application built with Ruby and Postgres, designed to organize and manage collections of games, music, books, and movies.

With the Catalog of Things, users can easily add their favorite games, music albums, books, and movies to their collection by entering relevant details such as title, genre, release date, artist/author, and more.
